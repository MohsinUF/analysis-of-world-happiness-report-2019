Analysis of the World Happiness Report 2019

We all are in eternal search for happiness. But do we really know what makes us happy? Well, the World  Happiness report 2019 tried to answer that question. 
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various life factors. The factors are (for 2019):
 GDP per capita
Healthy life expectancy
Social support
Generosity
Freedom of making choice
Perception of corruption
Seeing the dataset I felt curious to know which countries are at the top. So, I made a bar plot with the top ten countries. I was a little bit surprised to see all of the countries belong to the "rich" category. 

There are a lot of people out there who think "money can't buy happiness". The result shows the opposite. There is a high correlation between GDP per capita and happiness score in the dataset. More GDP leads to more happiness.


Happiness is also driven by healthy life expectancy and social support. The more you live, the more you are happy. 


Not surprisingly, healthy life expectancy and social support are also highly correlated with GDP. So, if you are rich, you live more and you are happier. You also get more support from the society. 



But what I found more interesting is the correlation between GDP and generosity. People in countries with lower GDP per capita tend to be very slightly more generous than the richer ones. 
Poors are not so poor, they have big ♥. 

Now, let's look at the position of Bangladesh in the ranking. In 2016, we were at 110th. We rank 125th in 2019. We are becoming more and more unhappy each year. 

However, don’t be unhappy to see the analyses.
